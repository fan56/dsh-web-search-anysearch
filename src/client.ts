/**
 * Client (browser) half of `@aiwayds/dsh-web-search-anysearch`.
 *
 * The provider is a Host-plane plugin; the one thing a browser can add for it is
 * the API-key row on the plugin's own page in the Plugins section. DSH gives a
 * bundle row a "Configure" control only while some Client half claims the keyed
 * `plugins.row.config` slot under `<package name>#<row id>`, so this file claims
 * this package's own row — the id `cordis.patch.yml` declares.
 *
 * The key never enters a configuration file: it is written through the official
 * `ctx.remote.credentials` namespace into the Host's managed credentials
 * document. The reference is the entry's own `apiKeyEnv` — the volatile config
 * value the Plugins page hands this row — falling back to the provider's
 * documented default (`ANYSEARCH_API_KEY`) only when the owner delivers no form.
 * The provider re-resolves that reference on every search, so a saved (or
 * cleared) key applies to the next search with no restart, and re-pointing
 * `apiKeyEnv` moves the row and the provider together instead of splitting them.
 *
 * Artifact form: the browser module table loads a classic script that registers a
 * lazy factory with `window.__ModuleLoader__.load`. This source is therefore a
 * global script — no imports, no exports — which the existing `tsc` build emits
 * verbatim, so no Client bundler is added to this repository. The IIFE keeps
 * every name out of the page's global namespace and out of the generated
 * declaration file.
